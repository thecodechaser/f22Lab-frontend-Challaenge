# F22Labs Frontend Challenge
## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

The challenge is for a total of 30 points. There are 8 tasks in total & each task has certain points attached to them(6 being the highest individual point for a task). Have a look through the entire codebase to understand each requirement & complete them.

Libraries/Packages used in the project: 

1. Tailwind CSS (You can write your own CSS in `App.css` if you  dont have any prior experience with Tailwind)
2. React Routers
3. Formik & Yup
4. Axios

These are the packages that are already available when you do `yarn install`. It is not compulsory that you have to work with these libraries alone. Feel free to add packages that you are comfortable with to complete the tasks. 
## Working on the Solution

- Clone the repo in your local machine & search for `# TASK`  keyword to start the challenge.

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

- Installs all dependencies that are needed to run the project.
### `yarn start`

- Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
## Few major things to consider

- App layout is mobile responsive by default. Once the tasks are completed it should still be `mobile responsive`. 
- We have attached few screenshots of the working app for your reference under `working_version` folder. There is also a video which can be accessed [here](https://www.loom.com/share/3286489fc6c849bea711056770526e6d). You can refer to them if you have any doubts on how the UI should look. 
## Deploying your project

- Clone this repo in your local machine.
- Work on the tasks within the stipulated time mentioned.
- Create your own `private repo`.
- Do modular commits ie. push the changes you do as a commit for every task you complete.
- Connect your repo with netlify and deploy the codebase.
- We recommend using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with. Here is a step by step guide to deploy this app via netlify, [blog](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/).

## Sharing your solution

1. Add `subbiahf22` as a collaborator in your repo.
2. Send us the URL of the deployed app once the task is completed.
3. Ensure that your repo is `private` & do not expose it as public at any cost.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
